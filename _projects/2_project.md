We developed an automated deep learning system for comprehensive body composition analysis from computed tomography (CT) scans, enabling accurate segmentation of muscle and fat tissues throughout the body.

## Key Features

- **Automated segmentation**: End-to-end deep learning pipeline for muscle and fat segmentation in CT images
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Supports both 2D and 3D body composition measurements
- **Clinical integration**: Enables automated quantification of body composition metrics for clinical decision support
- **High accuracy**: Robust segmentation performance across diverse patient populations and imaging protocols

## Clinical Applications

- **Surgical risk prediction**: Integration of body composition metrics improves risk stratification for surgical procedures (e.g., colectomy)
- **Nutritional assessment**: Automated quantification of muscle mass and fat distribution for nutritional status evaluation
- **Longitudinal monitoring**: Track body composition changes over time for disease progression and treatment response
- **Research applications**: Enable large-scale studies on body composition and its relationship to clinical outcomes

## Impact

This work demonstrates that integrating automated body composition analysis into clinical models significantly improves surgical risk prediction, highlighting the value of AI-driven body composition metrics in healthcare.
