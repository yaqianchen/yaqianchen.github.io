We developed an AI-based method for quantifying breast density in MRI and established its relationship with mammographic density assessment, enabling more comprehensive breast cancer risk evaluation.

## Key Contributions

- **AI-based quantification**: Automated segmentation and quantification of fibroglandular tissue (FGT) in breast MRI
- **Multi-modal correlation**: Established relationship between MRI-based and mammography-based density assessments
- **Extended segmentation**: Extended breast segmentation methods to include breast, vessel, and FGT components
- **Clinical validation**: Demonstrated the clinical utility of MRI-based density measurements for breast cancer risk assessment

## Clinical Significance

- **Risk stratification**: Breast density is a well-established risk factor for breast cancer; accurate quantification enables better risk assessment
- **Multi-modal imaging**: Bridges MRI and mammography assessments, providing complementary information for clinical decision-making
- **Longitudinal monitoring**: Enables tracking of breast density changes over time, which may be relevant for risk prediction
- **Demographic analysis**: Conducted comprehensive demographic analysis comparing MRI density with traditional mammographic density measurements

## Impact

Published in **npj Breast Cancer**, this work demonstrates the feasibility and clinical value of AI-based breast density quantification in MRI, providing a new tool for breast cancer risk assessment and patient care.
