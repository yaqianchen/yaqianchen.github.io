I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University, working in [Maciej Mazurowski's Lab](https://sites.duke.edu/mazurowskilab/) as part of the Duke AI Health Spark Initiative. My research focuses on applying deep learning to medical image analysis, with particular emphasis on medical image segmentation and registration, as well as adapting foundation models through self-supervised, semi-supervised, and fine-tuning approaches.

My current work includes developing registration networks for breast MRI, establishing benchmarks for foundation model-based registration, and creating automated segmentation systems for CT imaging. I have also conducted large-scale evaluations of vision foundation models like SAM2 across diverse medical imaging datasets.

Prior to joining Duke, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, where I worked in the Laboratory of Biomechanical and Image Guided Surgical Systems. I also have experience in surgical and general robotics development, with emphasis on path planning and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from my undergraduate research at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

I am passionate about bridging real-world clinical needs with advanced AI methodologies, and I have demonstrated this through collaborations with clinicians and contributions to multiple NIH grant proposals. My work has been recognized with awards including a best paper award at a MICCAI workshop.

For more details about my research and publications, please see my [publications page](/publications/) and [CV](/cv/).
