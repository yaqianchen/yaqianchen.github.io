About me: I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University, working at the intersection of AI and Healthcare. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Maciej A. Mazurowski](https://sites.duke.edu/mazurowski/) under [Duke Spark Initiative](https://spark.duke.edu/). My research focuses on applying deep learning to medical image analysis, with particular emphasis on medical image segmentation and registration, foundation models, and clinically relevant AI methodologies.

I am interested in several research topics, including foundation models, self-supervised and semi-supervised learning, fine-tuning strategies, and clinically meaningful AI. My work spans medical image segmentation, registration, body composition analysis, breast density estimation, and risk prediction. I have developed registration networks for breast MRI that outperform existing models, established benchmarks for foundation model-based registration (awarded best paper at MICCAI workshop), and contributed to multiple medical segmentation models through foundation model fine-tuning.

Before starting my Ph.D. at Duke, I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University, where I worked in the Laboratory of Biomechanical and Image Guided Surgical Systems. Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, where I worked on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and robotics applications.

See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iegKFuQAAAAJ&hl=en) for a full list of my publications, with a few highlights shown below.
